# Customization

By default, RxJS Insights instruments built-in RxJS constructors, creators and operators.
Instrumentation, while completely optional, has many advantages, including:
* simplified Observable identification by assigning it a custom name and/or tag,
* discovery of the source code locations pointing to the instrumented function usages,
* discovery of the arguments passed to the instrumented function.

The utilities described below make it possible to instrument custom-made constructors, creators, operators and observables.

## Declarations

## Decorators

## Operators
